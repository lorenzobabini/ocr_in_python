# OCR in Python
Optical Character Recognition using Pytesseract or EasyOCR, along with preprocessing and postprocessing techniques. Following and adapting these scripts you can build an OCR workflow for your projects.

Most tips and techniques are taken from these notebooks: https://github.com/ithaka/constellate-notebooks/tree/master/OCR
The example I used is a rare Italian book from the 1950s I have OCR'ed for a friend. So, spellcheker for postprocessing is based on italian language. The book is missing a couple of pages. This is why the page count in the OCR'ed file texts does not totally correspond to the page numbering of the book.
